# Snake-game
Snake game is a video game concept where the snake eats fruit and increases the length of its body which acts as an obstacle.
The concept of Snake game was orginated from an arcade game Blockade. Blockade was a two-player game where each player would guide their own snakes leaving a solid line behind them which would act as a blockade. The player who lasted the longest would win the game. 

The goal of the Snake game is to eat as many fruits as possible and get longer without colliding with its own body.
